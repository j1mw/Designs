Crude mounting plate for magballs with Stonflower / Nema17 Motor

- Based on Duet3D Smart Effector (SmartEffector_v2.0.step)
- Converted and edited in Fusion 360 to get a blank mounting with the 6 magball holes (smartEffector_stoneflower v2.stl)
- OpenSCAD file (smarteffector-stoneflower.scad) to merge stl with Nema mounting holes
