# Summary

I made this as a practice sculpt in 3dCoat.  I had so much fun that I made several variants.  
The print was done in clear PLA (what the machine was loaded with) and painted with rustoleum red primer and black acrylic paint.  The model is a solid so if you want to make a hollow mug you must print with zero infill and zero top layers.  
We talked about this thing and a whole lot more about 3d printing on the **3D Printing Today** podcast available on iTunes, Stitcher radio or direct from the source at http://threedprintingtoday.libsyn.com/

UPDATE: I uploaded a hollow version which you can print with infill and top layers.
